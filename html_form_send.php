            <p>As you'd expect, we're really good at delivering the <?php echo $business_2; ?> stuff - like <?php echo $compliance; ?>, <?php echo $tax_saving; ?> and profit improvement services ...and all in a very cost-effective way.</p>
            <p>But where we really differ, is how we work <span class="italic">with</span> our clients and the strong emphasis we place on the <span class="bold">'relationship'</span>.</p>
            <p>Unlike other accountants you may have met, we always put your needs ahead of our own. This means we'll always be there when you need us, ready to provide <span class="italic">imaginative</span> and <span class="italic">resourceful</span> <span class="bold">solutions</span> to your financial and business growth challenges.</p>
            <p><span class="underline">Including those challenges you didn't even know existed.</span></p>
            <p>After all, any decent <?php echo $business_3; ?> can produce a good set of accounts. But very few have the skills to create a relationship where the client really sees their accountant as <span class="bold italic">a true asset</span> to their business.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>And that's because a great <?php echo $business_3; ?> is one that does <span class="italic">so much more</span> than merely provide <?php echo $business_2; ?> services.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">A great <?php echo $business_3; ?> is one that gives your business the advantage it needs and demands.</span></p>
            <p>And that's where we <span class="italic">really</span> make the difference</p>
            <p>It doesn't matter whether you're just starting out, have an established business or you've been round the block a few times. We know what's required to create a <span class="bold">win-win relationship</span> for you.</p>
            <p>You'll even get a taste of this when you meet with us the very first time. So don't delay. <a href="#header">Complete the form now</a> or call us on <?php echo $phone; ?>. Thank you.</p>
