# ATC_L1

This documentation is for the ATC_L1 (AGP Traffic Converter Landing Page Design 1) Repository

----
NOTE: Any changes to the var.php, once approved and merged to the master repository must be applied to the ATC_L1 snippets in Gist - and be re-saved in Sublime Text.

## Installation

1. Locate your local working directory (MAMP/htdocs/) and cd through iTerm.
2. Initialise the local working directory as a git repository (git init).
3. Clone the repository by using the remote repository URL (git clone).

## Customisation & Setup

Customisation & Setup TBA

## Usage

The ATC_L1 is an exclusive landing site (comprised of a number of 'Google Adwords' keyword related landing pages). The site is set up and provided by Academy For Growth Ltd upon purchase.

## Contributing

1. Install as above.
2. Switch to the 'develop' branch and create branches from 'develop' to work on features/topics and hotfixes (or releases*) (git checkout -b yourbranchname develop).
3. Do your development work on the specific feature/topic/hotfix branch and do regular commits after editing files.
4. When you are ready to propose a merge, push your new branch (git push origin branchname) and then locate your branch on GitHub and activate a 'Pull Request'.
5. Once your pull request has been checked with a second-person approval, the merge can be accepted or further fixes can be proposed through the comment section of the "Pull Request" area.

NOTE:

The MASTER branch is where the source code always reflects a production-ready state.

The DEVELOP branch is the main branch where the source code always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. When the source code in the develop branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes should be merged into a RELEASE branch (tagged with a release number) and then merged to the MASTER branch.

SUPPORTING branches for Features/Topics (General planned development work, or Issues labelled with: "enhancement", "help wanted", "needs adding", "question" etc) or Hotfixes (Issues labelled with: "bug", "wontfix", "duplicate" or "invalid") are merged into the DEVELOP branch once a PULL REQUEST has been made.

*RELEASE branches are only made once the DEVELOP branch (almost) reflects the desired state of the new release. At least all features that are targeted for the release-to-be-built must be merged in to develop at this point in time. All features targeted at future releases may not - they must wait until after the release branch is branched off. This is when the upcoming release will get assigned a version number (not any earlier). RELEASE branches support preparation of a new production release. They allow for last-minute dotting of i's and crossing t's. Furthermore, they allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release (version numbers, build dates, etc.). By doing all of this work on a release branch, the DEVELOP branch is cleared to receive features for the next big release. RELEASE branches, when finishing a release branch, the RELEASE branch must be merged into the MASTER branch.
